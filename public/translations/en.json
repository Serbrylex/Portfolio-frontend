				"My first toutch with programming was while I was at the highschool, I studied programming in CBTis # 111 where i learned pseudocode, the C ++ basics, Java and something about mobile apps with Android Studio and with a friend i learn a little bit about Kotlin, by my own I learned the web development basics.",
				"When I finished high school I had to work and saving a little money I bought an annual subscription at Platzi, that's where I improved exponentially. I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Python, Django.",
				"I learn every day and even today I know more about frontend in the near future, I plan to be completely fullstack. My goal is to pay for the university with the money that I will save working as a software developer, I will enter the University of the Caribbean in the Bachelor's Degree: Data Engineering and Organizational Intelligence, because in their study plan they have economics, some physics, mathematics and a lot of programming. As long as I study there, I hope to get a scholarship to study in the United States and when I finish university I plan to live there and work in the space dream."
